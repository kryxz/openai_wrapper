# OpenAI API Wrapper

This Python script utilizes the OpenAI API to create a simple chatbot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you do the following:

- Get an OpenAI API key
- Install required libraries by running `pip install openai python-dotenv`

### Usage

1. Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/kryxz/openai_wrapper.git `
2. Go to project directory `cd openai_wrapper`
3. Create a `.env` file and add your key `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here`
4. Run the script `python openai_wrapper.py`

To exit the chat, type "q" and press Enter. Or you know, terminate the script. It's not like chatbots have feelings or anything.
